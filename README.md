ENORM Model crawler and visualizer for Object Relational Mapping

Personal project that implements my doctoral notation for Oject Relational Mapping (ENORM).
The enormServer is an web project to draw ENORM models from Java or Ruby source codes.
The ghubenorm is the crawler that I developed on my postdoc that can visit github projects, identify ORM configurations for Java/Ruby, and infer the data models from source code, storing on a database for further analysis.
